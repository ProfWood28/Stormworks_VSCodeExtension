SETTING UP YOUR WORKSPACE
----------------------
Please follow this guide for getting setup, after which working in Stormworks will become far easier for you.

    1. Download and install VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/

    2. In VSCode, add the extensions:
        - "Lua" by sumneko
        - "Lua Debug" by actboy168
        - (optionally) "XML Tools" by Josh Johnson 

    4. Download the LifeBoatAPI and LifeBoatAPI Guides from ttps://github.com/nameouschangey/STORMWORKS and place these in a folder:
        - MyFolder/StormworksProjects/LifeBoatAPI
        - MyFolder/StormworksProjects/LifeBoatAPI Guides

    3. Download the lua-doc files from 'Nelo, to provide intellisense: https://github.com/Rene-Sackers/StormworksLuaDocsGen. Place these in the same folder:
        - MyFolder/StormworksProjects/docs-missions.lua
        - MyFolder/StormworksProjects/docs-vehicles.lua

    5. Open this root folder "StormworksProjects" (or whatever you named it) in VS Code

    6. For each new project you wish to make, just create a new folder, e.g:
        - MyFolder/StormworksProjects/LifeBoatAPI
        - MyFolder/StormworksProjects/MySpeedboatMicroController
        - MyFolder/StormworksProjects/BigMissileGuidanceComputer

    7. You can now copy this RunExample.lua file, or edit it here, to specify which files to be minimized

    8. Using F5, you can run the file you're viewing, if you view the RunExample.lua file and press F5 - you will run the minimizer.

    8. Once minimized, you will then simply copy the output file into Stormworks.
